## About Me

My name is Tyler Main and I live in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I spent 8 years in the Marine Corps as a journalist and photographer. I then did the same job after I separated from active duty for the Navy as a civilian near Washington D.C. before finally moving home to Arkansas to pursue photography for myself for a year. While I've had a great time taking photos of all of the outdoor sports and natural wonders Arkansas has to offer, I feel it's time for me to move on. Coding seems to require certain skills that I believe match up with my own and there is a lot of opportunity in the industry. So, here I am at the beginning of this new journey and I feel very fortunate to be here.
