# My Reading Notes

## Reading Assignments for Code Fellows 102D40.

## About Me:

My name is Tyler Main and I live in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I spent 8 years in the Marine Corps as a journalist and photographer. I then did the same job after I separated from active duty for the Navy as a civilian near Washington D.C. before finally moving home to Arkansas to pursue photography for myself for a year. While I've had a great time taking photos of all of the outdoor sports and natural wonders Arkansas has to offer, I feel it's time for me to move on. Coding seems to require certain skills that I believe match up with my own and there is a lot of opportunity in the industry. So, here I am at the beginning of this new journey and I feel very fortunate to be here.

**Growth mindset** tells us that if we believe we will grow, then we will grow. If I maintain the mindset that my effort will payoff in time then I can stay focused and achieve my goals.

### Reminders:
1. Many things are difficult when you try them for the first time, don't let this discourage you.
2. Think and speak positively about yourself to reenforce a growth mindset.
3. Embrace challenges
4. Persist through obstacles, this is where growth happens
5. Remove defensiveness and be open to criticism
