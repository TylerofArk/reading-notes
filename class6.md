# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else you see on.

Javascript is used in web pages, web apps and products.

## Values and Variables

A value is a piece of data and the most fundamental unit of information in programming.

ex. console.log("Jonas") Jonas is the value.

It is use to store values inside of variables so we can use them over and over again.

It is also good practice to declare all of your variables at the beginning of your JS document to prevent bugs.

There are 3 ways to declare variables but most of the time you will use only 2 of the 3.

var - the old way of declaring variables
let - a variable that could change
const - a variable that will not change

**A variable is a box and the value is the label**

## Console.log

Whenever you need to ouput code from the editor to the browser you use console.log. This also allows you to check and see if your JS is working as intended and will give you detailed error messages to help you debug if the code is not working properly.
