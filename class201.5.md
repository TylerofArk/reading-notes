### Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community

A gif image is a one of the simplest and most compatible image formats. It is easy to use across a variety of different apps and browser and can even be animated.

An svg is used for diagrams and icons mostly and is an ideal candidate for use when you don't know how big the icon or diagram is going to be because svgs are losslessly scalable, meaning they don't look pixelated when you enlarge them.
