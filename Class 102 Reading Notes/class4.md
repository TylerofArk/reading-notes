# Structuring Web Pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is the practice of outlining or making a skeleton of a design for a website, app or product. Wireframing helps plan and develop a heirarchy for the elements of these website, apps and products.

- Wireframes can be done physically with sharpie and paper or digitally on a wireframing web app or whiteboard.

- Wireframes should be kept simple, detail will come later

### Final Thoughts on Wireframing

Consider the way your user will flow through the product.
Draft don't draw, sketch don't illustrate.

## Mozilla HTML Basics

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of the content on your website.

### Anatomy

![Anatomy of an HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png)

The main parts of an html element are:

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

## Semantics

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.

For example, the h1 element gives the text within it the meaning of the top level heading on a page. You wouldn't use the h1 element on body text for this reason.

Generally, if there is an application for using symantic elements in your code you should use it over a non-symantic element. For example, you wouldn't bold and increase the size of the top line of your website, you would just use the h1 element.
