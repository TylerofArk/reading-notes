# What is CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is the language of style for web development. Specifically, CSS works directly with HTML structure we built in the beginning of our website design.

CSS controls font size and style, page layout, color and many other visual aspects of web design.

To make a CSS file change your HTML file in VS Code you have to link it in the header of your HTML file like so:

<header>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</header>

When using CSS you must specify which element of the HTML document you'd like to change, then what change you'd like to make. That syntax looks like this:

h1 {
    background-color: grey;
    font-size: 100px;
}
