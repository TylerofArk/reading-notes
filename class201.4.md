# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

#### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

<a href="URL">description of link</a>

#### The href attribute contains what information?

The url and the desciption of the URL

#### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Be thoughtful in your link desciption. Use keywords link to describe where it's going to take the user.

Don't repeat the URL in the link text.

Don't use the word link or links in the link text.

Use the A, B, Cs of journalism: Accuracy, Brevity, Clarity.

## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow

### CSS Layout: Positioning

#### What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

#### What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

VS

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

#### ___ positioning is the default for every html element

Static positioning

#### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

#### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

A fixed element is going to remain at the same position on the page, even if you scroll. A good example of this is a navigation bar that doesn't scroll away but rather stays visible as a user works down the page.

An absolute positioned element allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right to set the location.

## Learn JS

### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

#### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation

function declaration happens at the beginning of the function when you're simply typing the word function letting Javascript know you are making a function. The invocation calls the function into action.

#### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.

Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.

### Miscellaneous

#### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater Efficiency

2. Engaged Collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness

#### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey

Engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students

I think these two benefits go hand in hand. Collaborating with another person is going to increase the level of possibility for what you can achieve compared to working alone which in turn is going to help you learn more because you are writing more and more complex code.

Learning from other students or anyone for that matter is one of the best ways to open up your mind to possibilities you couldn't see before.
