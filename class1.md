**Growth mindset** tells us that if we believe we will grow, then we will grow. If I maintain the mindset that my effort will payoff in time then I can stay focused and achieve my goals.

##### Reminders

1. Many things are difficult when you try them for the first time, don't let this discourage you.
2. Think and speak positively about yourself to reenforce a growth mindset.
3. Embrace challenges
4. Persist through obstacles, this is where growth happens
5. Remove defensiveness and be open to criticism
