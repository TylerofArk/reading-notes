## Choosing A Text Editor

#### What is a text editor

For starters, a text editor is maybe the most important tool in an aspiring web developer's tool box. The text editor does exactly what it sounds like, edits text. But the application itself is more complicated than that. A text editor allows an developer to type different syntax and code while assisting in formatting, copy editing and deployment.

#### Important Features of Text Editors

###### Code Complete

Many text editors can predict what syntax you are going to use and give you a list of common syntax that match the letters you are typing in the text editor. Instead of typing the entire line out use one of the suggestions and save yourself time and typing. 

###### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting helps a web developer stay more organized by color coding different syntax. This makes it clear to the developer where the key components of different code structures are. 

###### Extensions

Extensions are third-party sub-applications that add capability to a text editor. For example, instead of using a different application to preview your html, you can use an extension that is built into your text editor and keep all of your work within the application you're already using. There are thousands of different extensions available. Some text editors have a larger selection of extensions than others.

###### Themes

Eye strain is defintely a con in coding. You are staring at a screen all day. That's why a selection of different themes is important to making a great text editor. Themes change the color pallete of the text editor, allowing the user to select a theme that is easier on the eyes.

#### Final Thoughts

Ultimately, the text editor you choose will come down to personal preference which will likely be influenced by the features listed in the previous sections. There are many great text editors to choose from and you can make an argument about better or worse choices, but there seems to be no wrong choice.
